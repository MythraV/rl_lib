# Soft actor critic implementation in pytorch

Based on implementations from stable-baselines3 and https://github.com/pranz24/pytorch-soft-actor-critic.git

See test_sac.py for example usage

The policy network estimates mean and std for a Gaussian policy as the original paper[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.05905.pdf]
