# rl_lib

Implementations of popular RL control and prediction agents.
The Deep RL algorithms are implemented using PyTorch.

Includes the following list of algorithms

 **Control**
 
* REINFORCE
* Vanilla Actor-Critic
* [DDPG](agents/DDPG)
* [TD3](agents/TD3)
* [SAC](agents/SAC)

Classical Control [Single file implementations for specific environments]
* Monte-Carlo Control [Blackjack]
* Q-Learning [CartPole]


**Prediction**
* Monte-Carlo
* TD0


## Requirements

- pytorch
