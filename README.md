# rl_lib

Implementations of popular RL control and prediction agents.
The networks are implemented with pytorch for deep RL agents

Includes the following list of algorithms

Control
    REINFORCE
    Vanilla Actor-Critic
    [DDPG](agents/DDPG)
    [TD3](https://github.com/MythraV/rl_lib/tree/main/agents/TD3)
    [SAC](https://github.com/MythraV/rl_lib/tree/main/agents/SAC)

Classical Control [Single file implementations for specific environments]
        Monte-Carlo Control [Blackjack]
        Q-Learning [CartPole]


Prediction
    Monte-Carlo
    TD0
